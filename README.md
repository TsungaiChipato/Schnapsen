# Schnapsen
Based on the card strategy schnapsen game, whereby a bot will play the game.
Built an intelligent agent to play a simplified version of the game Schnapsen. The development will happen in three stages:

Implement a basic agent using the classic mini-max algorithm for the second part of the game (perfect information). Devise some basic heuristics, and test which work best.

Build an agent that also plays the first part of Schnapsen (imperfect information) based on Monte Carlo Sampling. Use knowledge representation to improve your heuristic.

Use machine learning to create an agent that learns.
